Supermarket Database Systems is a database systems about supermarket. The database systems is related to products, staffs, payments, and transactions at supermarket. 
I made this project with my friends to fulfill Database Systems Course Project at my university. We got 100 out of 100 for this project.

In this database, there are seven tables, PaymentMethod, TransactionHeader, TransactionDetail, MsProduct, MsCategory, MsStaff, and MsStaffPosition. Each table has their
own columns and Primary Key (PK). Furthermore, each column has its own data type.

To make this project, first we decided what kind of database systems that we wanted to make. We chose Supermarket Database Systems. Then, we made the Logical 
Entity Relationship Diagram. After that, we created the database. Then, we created the tables and the columns in the database. After that, we tried to insert datas 
to the tables and the columns. Last but not least, we also created the CREATE VIEW in the database.
